    "### 1.1.1 Background\n",
    "Bike-sharing systems have gained significant traction in urban areas as a sustainable and convenient means of transportation. Predicting bike rental demand is crucial for optimizing the allocation of bikes, ensuring availability, improving overall operational efficiency, and satisfying customers’ needs (Torrens University, 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors affecting bike share ridership in Toronto, Canada was conducted, utilizing year-round trip data, the research highlights the impact of socio-demographic attributes, land use, built environment, and weather on bike-sharing demand. It reveals that road network configuration, bike infrastructure, and temperature significantly influence ridership (El-Assi et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.2 Business Objectives\n",
    "Machine learning, a subset of Artificial Intelligence, has significantly enhanced inventory automation, cutting costs associated with misplaced items by 40% to 60% (Bokrantz et al., 2023). However, without meticulous planning, execution, and ongoing oversight of the AI model, achieving success remains uncertain, as 75 to 85 percent of ML projects fail to fulfill their sponsors' expectations (Studer et al., 2021). Presently, CRISP-DM stands as the most effective methodology for managing ML projects (Studer et al., 2021), and it will be utilized to ensure the success of this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The data for this project, sourced from (Hadi, 2009), includes datasets of a bike-sharing company called Capital-Bikeshare15 in Washington D.C. including the weather and seasonal information. The project will be structured around the CRISP-DM phases: Business Understanding, Data Understanding, Data Preparation, Modeling, Evaluation, and Deployment (Leaper, 2024).\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to develop a robust predictive model that accurately forecasts daily bike rental demand based on historical data, weather conditions, calendar information, and user type, aiding in efficient bike distribution and minimizing shortages or surpluses at docking stations.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the optimal model and avoid the bias associated with relying on a single technique, I will develop four distinct models using four different algorithms, compare their performances, and select the best one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1.3 Business Success Criteria\n",
    "Success will be evaluated by the accuracy of the selected predictive model, reflected by metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared as a Percentage & Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and its ability to improve resource allocation, leading to increased satisfaction among stakeholders (customers, entrepreneurs, and government) and enhanced operational efficiency. These daily model predictions help us identify peak usage days.\n"

    "Blomster and Koivumäki (2022) emphasize that every entity needs diverse resources, capabilities, and competencies to advance a machine-learning project effectively. As a result, the resources for this project encompass:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **Personnel:** Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Engineer (myself).\n",
    "- **Resources:** Historical bike rental data, weather data, and calendar information.\n",
    "- **Requirements:** Ensure precise forecasting of bike rentals and deploy the model for operational use. Create a predictive model that achieves high accuracy in its forecasts.\n",
    "- **Assumptions:** The data reflects future trends; however, external factors like promotions and roadworks are not considered. Historical patterns are expected to persist without significant interruptions.\n",
    "- **Constraints:** Limited to historical data and available features; computational resources for training models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.2 Risk and Contingencies\n",
    "Krishnan (2015) underscores the critical role of risk identification in machine learning projects. For this project, the following risks have been identified:\n",
    "- **Data Quality Issues:** Missing or inaccurate data can impact model performance. Mitigation includes data cleaning and validation steps.\n",
    "- **Model Overfitting:** Models might overfit training data and perform poorly on unseen data. Cross-validation and regularization techniques will be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2.3 Cost and Benefit\n",
    "The financial feasibility and long-term viability of healthcare investments using a machine learning approach to panel regression have been assessed and shown to be a highly effective choice for ML projects (R & N, 2024). Consequently, the cost and benefits of this project are evaluated.\n",

    "Entities invest heavily in Big Data and Machine Learning (ML) projects, yet many of these projects are forecasted to fail (Supakkul et al., 2020). Therefore, it is crucial to define the ML success criteria before making investments and commitments. The main success criterion is to achieve the best Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared as a Percentage, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE),  demonstrating high predictive accuracy on the test data. Moreover, the selected model should be interpretable and offer actionable insights for operational decision-making.<br>\n",

    "The results from the holdout data show that the Gradient Boosting model is performing well on new, unseen data, with consistent and strong metrics. The slightly higher R² and lower MAE on the holdout set are positive signs that the model generalizes well and maintains accuracy when applied to data it hasn't seen before. The slight increase in MAPE is not a major concern, as the other metrics still indicate strong performance.\n",

    "Deploying an AI model on Azure requires careful configuration, an active subscription, and practical use of JSON (Siddhardhan, 2024). The steps I followed to deploy the model are outlined below:\n",
    "- Create an Azure Account or Sign in:\n",
    "    - If you don't have an Azure account, create one at Azure at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ or https://portal.azure.com/#home.\n",
    "- Create a Resource Group:\n",
    "    - In the Azure portal, navigate to \"Resource groups\" and click \"Create.\"\n",
    "    - Select your subscription, provide a name for the resource group (e.g., \"MLN601\"), and choose a region.\n",

    "**Challenges Encountered:** Acquiring the dataset was challenging, as discussed in Section 2 of this document. The limited time frame made it difficult to explore alternative options and develop a more refined application interface.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "**Successes:** A significant amount of learning occurred through the implementation of models in real-world scenarios. I successfully transformed the model into a web application, which was both an impressive and rewarding experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.5.3 Recommendations\n",
    "#### Future Work: \n",
    "- **Enhance Model and Interface:** The model and interface should be designed to handle multiple predictions at once (can upload files as well), providing users with results and charts of the predicted demand.\n",
    "- **Geographic Flexibility:** The model should be adaptable to different locations, accounting for demand variations across regions.\n",
    "- **API Integration:** Implement the API in a real-world setting to assess how it interacts with other applications.\n",
    "- **Automated Data Fetching:** Integrate forecasts from external APIs to eliminate the need for manual data entry. Users should be able to select a location and date, with all other necessary features being automatically retrieved for prediction.\n",
    "- **User Data Tracking:** The app should track user inputs and responses, enabling enhancements and providing a personalized experience for future use.\n",
    "- **Hourly Prediction:** The updated version should be able to give a breakdown of hourly demand per day to ensure consistent business operations.\n"
